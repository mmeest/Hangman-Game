* Maximum for the game is 100 points.
* Minimum can be 0 points(calculation will never go below 0 points).
* At the beginning of the game every right letter is worth 10 points.
* Every wrong letter devaluates the 10 points value for the right letters by 1 point and 1 point will be removed from total count.
* By selecting a letter that is already selected, 2 points will be removed from total.
* If player can't guess the word on total moves, the final points count will be divided by 2.
